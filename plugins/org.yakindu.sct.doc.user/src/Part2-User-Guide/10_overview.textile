h1(#what-are-yakindu-statechart-tools). What are YAKINDU Statechart Tools?

The statechart tools are a central part of YAKINDU: the modular toolkit for model-driven development of embedded systems. It is based on the open-source development platform Eclipse. YAKINDU Statechart Tools (YAKINDU SCT) provide the following tools to deal with state machine diagrams:

* *Statechart diagram editor* to graphically create and edit statecharts
* *Statechart simulator* to simulate the behavior of statecharts
* *Code generators for Java, C, C&#43;&#43;* to transform statecharts into code
* *Custom generator projects* to easily create model-to-text transformations with Xtend/Java or Xpand
* *Integrated validator* to check for syntactical or semantical problems of the statechart model 

The following graph shows these features and their relation to each other:
