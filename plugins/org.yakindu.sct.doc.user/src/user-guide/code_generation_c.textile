h3(#codegen_c_specification_of_c_code). Specification of C code

In order to describe the API specifications of the code generated by the YAKINDU C generator, the explanations below are using the _Traffic Light_ sample state machine, see "figure &quot;The _Traffic Light_ sample statechart model&quot;":#codegen_c_fig_the_traffic_light_sample_statechart_model. It models a pedestrian crossing with push-button operated traffic lights ("pelican crossing").

p=. The _Traffic Light_ sample statechart model

###. You can find the C sample project _"Traffic Light &#40;C)":https://github.com/Yakindu/examples/tree/master/traffic_light_c_ in the "YAKINDU Statechart Tools examples repository":https://github.com/Yakindu/examples. The C example contains statechart, SGen model, graphical widgets, and some glue code to connect the generated code with the widgets. The graphical widgets are based on Qt.

###. To execute the C example, run the file _org&#95;yakindu&#95;sct&#95;examples&#95;c&#95;trafficlight&#95;_ as _Local C/C++ application_ from the Eclipse _Run As_ context menu.


h4(#codegen_c_generated_code_files). Generated code files

You will find the generated code in the _src-gen_ folder of the traffic light example.

The C code generator generates two or three header files, depending on the statechart.

* _sc_types.h_: Contains type definitions used by the statechart. Since the contents of this file is always the same for all statecharts, it will be generated only if it does not yet exist. And since it will never be overwritten, you can change or amend the definitions made there. For example, you might wish to adapt the types to better match your target platform.
* _Statechart.h_: Contains the basic declarations for everything needed in the underlying statechart's code. The file is named after the statechart, i.e., if the statechart's name is _TrafficLight_, this file's name will be _TrafficLight.h_. It is always generated.
* _StatechartRequired.h_: Contains declarations of functions _the developer has to implement_. The file is named after the statechart, i.e., if the statechart's name is _TrafficLight_, this file's name will be _TrafficLightRequired.h_. It is generated only if one or more of the following conditions are fulfilled:
** The statechart declares _operations_.
** The statechart uses _timing features_.
** The code generator model activates the "Tracing feature":#codegen_c_tracing_feature.

 The first one is _sc&#95;types.h_:

p. Within this header file an @enum@ containing the state names is defined as well as data structures for each of the statechart's interfaces. Additionally a structure for the statechart's time events is defined. The interfaces' and time events' data structures are nested into the parent structure @TrafficLight@. The client has to allocate memory for this structure. It is a common parameter of most functions the generated state machine code defines. In the subsequent text, this structure is called the _statechart data structure_.


h5(#codegen_c_defines_and_constants_in_the_statechart_header_file). Defines and constants in the statechart header file

The header file _Statechart.h_ contains several _#define_ statements for constants that are explained below, based on the _TrafficLight_ example and the header file shown above.

* @#define TRAFFICLIGHTWAITING_MAX_ORTHOGONAL_STATES 1@: The orthogonality of this statechart, that is, the maximum number of states that will be active at the same time. The _state configuration vector_ manages the active states. It has this many entries.
* @#define TRAFFICLIGHTWAITING_MAX_ACTIVE_TIME_EVENTS 2@: The maximum number of time events this statechart will have to wait for simultaneously. When writing a timer service, you can use this constant to plan for the amount of memory you will have to allocate for timers. (Take a look at the traffic light statechart. Can you find the state in which two time events will be active at the same time?)
* @#define SCVI_TRAFFICLIGHTWAITING_MAIN_REGION_ON 0@ (and so on): The index of the state in the _state configuration vector_. Since this example does not have any orthogonal regions, all indices are 0. If states are orthogonal to each other, their index will be different.


h5(#codegen_c_fundamental_statechart_functions). Fundamental statechart functions

The generated code contains fundamental functions to initialize, enter, and exit a state machine, as well as a function to execute a run-to-completion step.

In the header file, the function names are made up of the state machine name followed by the name of the respective functionality. For the traffic light example, these functions are generated as follows:

bc.. 
/*! Initializes the TrafficLight state machine data structures. Must be called before first usage.*/
extern void trafficLight_init(TrafficLight* handle);

/*! Activates the state machine */
extern void trafficLight_enter(TrafficLight* handle);

/*! Deactivates the state machine */
extern void trafficLight_exit(TrafficLight* handle);

/*! Performs a 'run to completion' step. */
extern void trafficLight_runCycle(TrafficLight* handle);

p. 

<ul><li><p>The _init()_ function is used to initialize the internal objects of the state machine right after its instantiation. Variables are initialized to their respective default values. If the statechart defines any initialized variables, these initializations are also done in the _init()_ function.</p></li><li><p>The _enter()_ function must be called to enter the state machine. It brings the state machine to a well-defined state.</p></li><li><p>The _exit()_ function is used to leave a state machine statefully. If for example a history state is used in one of the top regions, the last active state is stored and the state machine is left via _exit()_. Re-entering it via _enter()_ continues to work with the saved state.</p></li><li><p>The _runCycle()_ function is used to trigger a run-to-completion step in which the state machine evaluates arising events and computes possible state changes. Somewhat simplified, a run-to-completion cycle consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>Clear the list of outgoing events.</p></li><li><p>Check whether any events have occurred which are leading to a state change.</p></li><li><p>If a state change has to be done:</p><ol><li><p>Make the present state inactive.</p></li><li><p>Execute exit actions of the present state.</p></li><li><p>Save history state, if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Execute transition actions, if any.</p></li><li><p>Execute entry actions of the new state.</p></li><li><p>Make the new state active.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Clear the list of incoming events.</p></li></ol></li></ul>


h5(#codegen_c_accessing_variables_and_events). Accessing variables and events

The client code can read and write state machine variables and raise state machine events. The getters and setters for each variable and event are also contained in the header file. The function names are matching the following pattern:

_statechart_name_ @Iface@ _interface_name_@_@ [ @set@ | @get@ | @raise@ ] @_@ [_variable_name_|_event_name_]

For example, the getter of the _red_ variable of the _Pedestrian_ interface is named @trafficLightIfacePedestrian_get_red(TrafficLight* handle)@



h4(#codegen_c_time-controlled_state_machines). Time-controlled state machines

If a statechart uses timing functionality or external operations, or tracing is activated in the generator model, an additional header file is generated. Its name matches the following pattern:

_statechart_name_@Required.h@

This header file declares functions the client code has to implement externally.

h5(#codegen_c_time-controlled_state_machines_example). Example

The traffic light example uses timing functionality, namely _after_ clauses. To support time-controlled behavior, the additional header file _TrafficLightRequired.h_ is generated. Note the two functions _trafficLight_setTimer_ and _trafficLight_unsetTimer_..

bc..

#endif 

#endif /* TRAFFICLIGHTWAITINGREQUIRED_H_ */
/

p. Basically the proper time handling has to be implemented by the developer, because timer functions generally depend on the hardware target used. So for each hardware target the client code must provide a function to set a timer and another function to unset it. These functions have to be implemented externally and have to be linked to the generated code.

The following functions are dealing with timing functionality:


h5(#codegen_c_function_settimer). Function setTimer

A state machine calls the _setTimer()_ function – short for the function's full name like, e.g., @void trafficLight_setTimer(TrafficLight* handle, const sc_eventid evid, const sc_integer time_ms, const sc_boolean periodic)@ – to tell the timer service that it has to start a timer for the given time event identifier and raise it after the period of time specified by the _time&#95;ms_ parameter has expired. It is important to only start a timer thread or a hardware timer interrupt within the _setTimer()_ function and avoid any time-consuming operations like extensive computations, sleeping or waiting. Never call the statechart API functions from within these functions! Otherwise the state machine execution might hang within the timer service or might not show the expected runtime behavior.

In order to have the timer service raise the time event periodically, the parameter _periodic_ must be _true_.


h5(#codegen_c_function_unsettimer). Function unsetTimer

The state machine calls the function @trafficLight_unsetTimer(TrafficLight* handle, const sc_eventid evid)@ to notify the timer service to unset the timer for the given event ID.


h5(#codegen_c_function_raisetimeevent). Function raiseTimeEvent

In order to notify the state machine about the occurence of a time event after a period of time has expired, the _raiseTimeEvent()_ function – defined in the header file of the state machine – needs to be called on the state machine. In the case of the traffic light example it is named @trafficLight_raiseTimeEvent(const TrafficLight* handle, sc_eventid evid)@ (in file _TrafficLight.h_).

The time event is recognized by the state machine and will be processed during the next run cycle.

You can conclude that in order to process the time events raised by the timing service without too much latency, the runtime environment has to call the state machine's _runCycle()_ function as frequently as needed. Consider for example a time event which is raised by the timer service after 500 ms. However, if the runtime environment calls the state machine's _runCycle()_ function only once per 1000 ms, the event will quite likely not be processed at the correct points in time.



h4(#codegen_c_operation_callbacks). Operation callbacks

YAKINDU Statechart Tools support client code _operations_ that can be called by a state machine and that are executed as actions. These operations have to be implemented in order to make a statechart executable. The figure below shows a sample statechart using an operation:

!images/docu_operationExample.png(Specifying an operation callback in the model)!

p=. Specifying an operation callback in the model

Let's have a look at the generated code in _DefaultSMRequired.h_:

There are some constraints that have to be considered for the implementation of these functions:

*/
extern sc_integer defaultSMIfaceSample_myOperation(const DefaultSM* handle, const sc_integer p1, const sc_boolean p2);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif 

#endif /* DEFAULTSMREQUIRED_H_ */

p. An additional external function declaration @sc_integer defaultSMIfaceSample_myOperation(DefaultSM* handle, const sc_integer p1, const sc_boolean p2)@ has been generated. This function has to be implemented and linked with the generated code, so that the state machine can use it.


h4(#codegen_c_integrating_generated_code). Integrating generated code

To get a clue how to integrate a generated C state machine with your project, have a look at this _main.c_ file and its _main()_ function. Please note that the _trafficLight_setTimer_ and _trafficLight_unsetTimer_ functions are implemented here as well:

bc.. 
#include "org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight.h"

#include "src-gen/sc_types.h"
#include "src-gen/TrafficLight.h"
#include "statemachine/TrafficLightTimer.h"
#include "statemachine/TrafficLightRunner.h"

TrafficLightTimer *timer;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    TrafficLight handle;
    trafficLight_init(&handle);
    timer = new TrafficLightTimer(&handle);
    trafficLight_enter(&handle);
    QApplication a(argc, argv);
    TrafficLightRunner *runner = new TrafficLightRunner(&handle, 100);
    org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight w(0, runner);
    w.show();
    int ret = a.exec();
    return ret;
}

void trafficLight_setTimer(const sc_eventid evid,
        const sc_integer time_ms, const sc_boolean periodic) {
    timer->setTimer(evid, time_ms, periodic);
}

void trafficLight_unsetTimer(const sc_eventid evid) {
    timer->unsetTimer(evid);
}

p. First an instance of the statechart data structure is created and initialized by the _trafficLight_init(&handle)_ function. The next step instantiates the timer. The class _TrafficLightTimer_ represents an implementation of a timer service and uses the timer functionality of the Qt framework. The _TrafficLightRunner_ is a runtime service that executes a run-to-completion step of the state machine every 100 ms. The runner class and the GUI are wired in the C++ class _org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight_:

bc.. 
#include "org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight.h"

org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight::org_yakindu_sct_examples_c_trafficlight(
        QWidget *parent, TrafficLightRunner *runner) :

    crossing = new CrossingWidget(this);

    trafficLight = new TrafficLightWidget(crossing);
    trafficLight->setGeometry(275, 75, 30, 90);

    pedestrianLight = new PedestrianLightWidget(crossing);
    pedestrianLight->setGeometry(50, 10, 70, 20);

    connect(runner, SIGNAL(cycleDone(TrafficLight*)), this, SLOT(update(TrafficLight*)));

    pedestrianReq = new QPushButton("pedestrian request", this);
    pedestrianReq->setGeometry(1, 365, 150, 30);
    connect(pedestrianReq, SIGNAL(released()), runner, SLOT(raisePedestrianRequest()));


    off = new QPushButton("off / on", this);

==<!-- Start sgen_feature_identifiersettings -->==

h4(#codegen_c_identifiersettings_feature). IdentifierSettings feature

The *IdentifierSettings* feature allows the configuration of module names and identifier character length:

* _moduleName_ (String, optional): Name for header and implementation. By default, the name of the statechart is used.
* _statemachinePrefix_ (String, optional): Prefix that is prepended to function, state, and type names. By default, the name of the statechart is used.
* _separator_ (String, optional): Character to replace whitespace and otherwise illegal characters in names.

Please note that the _maxIdentifierLength_ option, which existed in older versions of YAKINDU Statechart Tools, has been removed in favor of a statechart annotation that is only available in the C/C++ domain bundled with YAKINDU Statechart Tools Professional Edition, see "@ShortIdentifiers":../user-guide/c_domain.textile#cdom_annotations_short_identifiers.

==<div class="example">==

Example:

bc. feature IdentifierSettings {

    maxIdentifierLength = 31
    separator = "_"
}

h4(#codegen_c_generatoroptions_feature). GeneratorOptions feature

The *GeneratorOptions* feature allows the configuration of additional aspects concerning the behavior of the generated code:

* _inEventQueue_ (Boolean, optional): For @EventDriven statecharts, use a queue for in events. Defaults to false. This is useful (with further synchronization) in multi-threaded environments or when you want to raise in events from operations declared in the statechart.
* _userAllocatedQueue_ (Boolean, optional): If you want to allocate the buffer used by queues yourself, use this option. Defaults to false.

==<div class="example">==

Example:

bc. feature GeneratorOptions {

h4(#codegen_c_tracing_feature). Tracing feature

The *Tracing* feature enables the generation of tracing callback functions:

* _enterState_ (boolean, optional): Specifies whether to generate a callback function that is used to notify about state-entering events.
* _exitState_ (boolean, optional): Specifies whether to generate a callback that is used to notify about state-exiting events.
* _generic_ (boolean, optional): Specifies whether to generate callbacks that are used to notify about any changes. These can be implemented manually or by the Yet Tracer.

==<div class="example">==

Example:

bc. feature Tracing {
    enterState = true
    exitState  = true
    generic = true
}

==</div>==

==<!-- End sgen_feature_tracing -->==

h4(#codegen_c_yet_generator). Yet Tracer

The *Yet Tracer* is a C generator extension, which allows the use of the *Yet Tracing* run option. The generated C code implements the callback funtions, which fit into the generated architecture of the generic tracing feature. To use the Yet Tracer, please also supply a C generator with generic Tracing feature enabled.

h4(#codegen_c_includes_feature). Includes feature

The *Includes* feature allows to change how include statements are generated:

* _useRelativePaths_ (Boolean, optional): If this parameter is set to _true_, relative paths are calculated for include statements, otherwise simple includes are used. Default: _true_.

==<div class="example">==

Example:

bc. feature Includes {
    useRelativePaths = false
}

==</div>==

==<!-- End sgen_feature_includes -->==

==<!-- Start sgen_feature_eventprocessing -->==

h4(#codegen_generating_code_eventprocessing_feature). EventProcessing feature

The *EventProcessing* feature enables different generator features, which are used for determining the event processing strategy:

* _inEventBuffer_ (Boolean, optional): the state machine applies event buffering for incoming events in cycle based execution mode. Events can safely be raised during a run to completion step. Buffering requires double memory for event storage. Default true.
* _internalEventBuffer_ (Boolean, optional): the state machine applies event buffering for internal events in cycle based execution mode. If enabled internal events are processed in a separate step. If disabled internal events are just visible in lower priority regions. Buffering requires double memory for event storage. Default true.
* _inEventQueue_ (Boolean, optional): use an event queue for incoming events in event driven execution mode. Events can safely be raised during a run to completion step. Buffering requires double memory for event storage. Default true.

==<div class="example">==

Example:

bc. feature EventProcessing {
    inEventBuffer = false
    internalEventBuffer = true
    inEventQueue = false
}

==<!-- Start sgen_feature_outeventapi -->==

h4(#codegen_generating_code_outeventapi_feature). OutEventAPI feature

The *OutEventAPI* feature enables different generator features, which are used for out events:

* _observables_ (Boolean, optional): uses observables for out events. Default true.
* _getters_ (Boolean, optional): uses getters for out events. Follows the API of SCT 3.x. Default false.

==<div class="example">==

Example:

bc. feature OutEventAPI {
    observables = true
    getters = true
}
