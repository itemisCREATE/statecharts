h1(#overview_what_are_yakindu_statechart_tools). What are YAKINDU Statechart Tools?

YAKINDU Statechart Tools (YAKINDU SCT) is a modular toolkit for developing, simulating, and generating executable "_finite-state machines (FSM)_":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine or simply _state machines_. State machines are useful for the model-driven development of so-called event-discrete systems, i.e. systems that are always in exactly one state of a finite number of states. State machines are particularly well-suited for embedded systems, but they are in no way restricted to them.

With YAKINDU Statechart Tools you can easily develop and simulate state machines, as well as generating them as source code for your target software system. YAKINDU Statechart Tools is based on the open-source development platform Eclipse.

The Standard Edition of YAKINDU Statechart Tools provides the following features for dealing with state machines:

* *Statechart diagram editor* to graphically create and edit statecharts, the graphical representation of state machines
* *Statechart simulator* to simulate the behavior of statecharts
* *Code generators for Java, C, C++, and TypeScript* to transform statecharts into programming language source code
* *Custom generator projects* to easily create model-to-text transformations with Xtend or Java in order to create any code of your own choice
* *Integrated validator* to check for syntactical or semantical problems of the statechart model
* *Testing framework* to test your state machines with unit tests

The following graph shows these features and their relation to each other:

The Professional Edition of YAKINDU Statechart Tools makes additional features available:

* "*Deep integration with the C programming language*":../user-guide/c-domain to directly access C variables, types etc.
* "*Advanced simulation and debugging*":../user-guide/advanced_simulation with breakpoints and snapshots
