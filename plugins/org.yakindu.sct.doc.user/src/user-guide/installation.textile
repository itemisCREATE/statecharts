h3(#inst_installing_on_linux_installing_required_packages). Troubleshooting

Depending on your Linux distribution and version, you might need to install additional packages for *Webkit GTK* from your distribution's repository (or elsewhere). Below please find the necessary commands for some Linux distributions. To execute them, you have to have system administrator permissions. So please create a _root_ command-line shell or use the _sudo_ command, which is the typical procedure on Linux.

The list of Linux distributions mentioned below is in no way meant to be exhaustive. If your Linux distribution is not yet among them and you manage to find out the proper commands for it, please let us know!

On Linux, Eclipse uses the GTK library for drawing the user interface. Some users experience issues, especially when using the default version GTK3. If your installation of YAKINDU Statechart Tools does not perform as expected, is laggy, has drawing issues or looks weird, refer to "Configuring YAKINDU Statechart Tools to use GTK2":#inst_linux_gtk2. If the welcome page looks broken and asks you to configure _webkitgtk_, refer to "Webkit GTK":#inst_installing_on_linux_webkit_gtk.


h4(#inst_linux_gtk2). Configuring YAKINDU Statechart Tools to use GTK2

_GTK+_ is one of two major graphics libraries used in the Linux world (the other one being _Qt_), and it is the one being used by the Eclipse project, on which YAKINDU Statechart Tools are based. There are two different versions of GTK+: The newest one is often referred to as "GTK3", and the old one is named "GTK2" or just "GTK".

Eclipse made the switch from GTK2 to GTK3 with the Mars release. While in general it looks and performs somewhat better, some users experience issues with it, especially concerning the performance or just drawing bugs, like wrong colors being used or widgets not displaying properly. If you experience anything like that, you should try to configure YAKINDU Statechart Tools to use GTK2, which is fairly easy to do.

h5. Giving GTK2 a try

You can use GTK2 instead of GTK3 on a case-by-case basis by having the environment variable or shell variable _SWT_GTK3_ set as shown below when starting YAKINDU Statechart Tools. On the command line, you would usually start the stand-alone YAKINDU Statechart Tools like this:

bc. ./SCT

This assumes your current directory is the tool's installation folder.

To use GTK2, execute this command instead:

bc. SWT_GTK3=0 ./SCT

It defines the _SWT_GTK3_ shell variable _SWT_GTK3_ with a value of 0 and passes it to the _SCT_ process.

If you installed YAKINDU Statechart Tools into another Eclipse instance, the corresponding command to start that Eclipse instance is:

bc. SWT_GTK3=0 ./eclipse

h5. Permanently changing to GTK2

If you want to make your switch to GTK2 permanent without having to set the _SWT_GTK3_ variable each time, you can define that in the tool's _.ini_ file. In a stand-alone YAKINDU Statechart Tools installation, that's the file _SCT.ini_ in the _yakindu-sct_ installation folder. If you installed YAKINDU Statechart Tools into an existing Eclipse installation instead, it's the file _eclipse.ini_ in that Eclipse instance's installation directory.

Navigate to the _yakindu-sct_ installation folder of your YAKINDU Statechart Tools instance or to the _eclipse_ installation folder of your Eclipse instance, and open the file _SCT.ini_ or _eclipse.ini_, respectively, with a plain-text editor of your choice.

Look for the "-vmargs" line. Right _above_ this line, paste these two new lines:

bc. 
--launcher.GTK_version
2

The result looks similar to this:

bc. 
-startup
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.4.0.v20161219-1356.jar
--launcher.library
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.gtk.linux.x86_64_1.1.550.v20170928-1359
--launcher.GTK_version
2
-vmargs
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.8
-Xms256m
-server
-XX:PermSize=256m
-XX:+UseParallelGC
-Xmx3G

bq. *Please note*: Do _not_ attempt to replace all of the contents of your _SCT.ini_ file with the lines above! The specified version numbers have to match your installation, and if you change them, SCT will not be able to start anymore.

In order to double-check that YAKINDU Statechart Tools now uses GTK2, please proceed as follows:
* Start YAKINDU Statechart Tools.
* Navigate to _Help → About YAKINDU SCT → Installation Details → Configuration_. You will get a bunch of text containing all kinds of internal variables.
* Somewhat down the lines, you will find the _org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.version_ entry. Its major version number should now be 2 instead of 3, for example 2.24.30.


h4(#inst_installing_on_linux_webkit_gtk). Webkit GTK

On Linux, you might encounter certain user interface problems or display irregularities when working with Eclipse-based software, e.g., when viewing the welcome page. This is a general problem that can also affect YAKINDU Statechart Tools. It is due to Eclipse on Linux needing specific versions of the _libwebkitgtk_ library to function properly. Depending on your Linux distribution and version, you already have a suitable _libwebkitgtk_ library installed or not.

Commands for installing proper _libwebkitgtk_ versions:


*Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS:*

bc. 
sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-1.0.0
sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-3.0.0


*Fedora 25 Workstation:*

bc. yum install webkitgtk


*openSUSE Leap 42.2:*

_Works out of the box; nothing to be done._


*Red Hat Workstation 7.3:*

# Download the RPM file _webkitgtk-2.4.9-1.el7.x86_64.rpm_ from, e.g., "http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/31819125/dir/redhat_el_7/com/webkitgtk-2.4.9-1.el7.x86_64.rpm.html":http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/31819125/dir/redhat_el_7/com/webkitgtk-2.4.9-1.el7.x86_64.rpm.html.
# Install the downloaded RPM file using the following command, assuming you downloaded the file to _/opt/software/webkitgtk-2.4.9-1.el7.x86_64.rpm_:

h2(#inst_installing_to_an_existing_eclipse_instance). Installing to an existing Eclipse instance

This chapter describes the steps that are needed to install YAKINDU Statechart Tools to an existing Eclipse instance. Let's assume you already have Eclipse up and running and now you want to install YAKINDU Statechart Tools as an additional software item (plugin).

bq. *Please note:* On macOS, this only works if your _.app_ file is located in your _Applications_ folder.

In the the _Help_ menu, select the _Install New Software_ menu item:

!images/inst_eclipse_010_eclipse_menu_install_new_software.png(Selecting "Help → Install New Software" in the main menu)!

p=. Selecting _Help → Install New Software_ in the main menu

The _Install_ wizard opens:

!images/inst_eclipse_020_eclipse_install_wizard.png(The "Install" wizard)!

p=. The _Install_ wizard

Click on the _Add..._ button near the upper right corner of the wizard.

A dialog opens, asking you to specify the update repository you want to install the new software from.

bq. *Please note:* Update site URLs are available online via the "YAKINDU Statechart Tools download page":https://info.itemis.com/state-machine/download-yakindu-statechart-tools.

!images/inst_eclipse_030_eclipse_add_repository.png(Adding a software repository)!

p=. Adding a software repository

After entering name and location of the update repository, click _OK_.

Eclipse establishes a network connection to the update repository, asks it for available software items and shows them in the install wizard:

!images/inst_eclipse_040_eclipse_software_items.png(Selecting YAKINDU Statechart Tools software items)!

p=. Selecting YAKINDU Statechart Tools software items

Please check at least _Xtext Integration Utilities_ and – no surprise – _YAKINDU SCT_. (You can also install the respective source code items. However, unless you want to have a look at that source code or even want to modify it, you don't need them.)

Click _Next &gt;_.

Eclipse tries to integrate the new software with the software that is already installed. If it detects any mismatches between requirements and provisions, Eclipse will try to find a solution in order to mitigate this problem. The screenshot below shows such a case:

!images/inst_eclipse_050_eclipse_trouble.png(Install remediation page)!

p=. Install remediation page

Select the most appropriate solution, then click _Next &gt;_.

The wizard shows the software to be installed and gives you the opportunity to review the changes:

!images/inst_eclipse_060_eclipse_review.png(Reviewing the items to be installed)!

p=. Reviewing the items to be installed

Click _Next &gt;_.

The wizard asks you to review and accept the terms of the new software's license agreements.

!images/inst_eclipse_070_eclipse_licenses.png(Accepting the new software's license agreements)!

p=. Accepting the new software's license agreements

Select the radio button labelled _I accept the terms of the license agreements_ (if you do), then click _Finish_.

Eclipse starts to download the software and installs it on your computer. This may take some time.

!images/inst_eclipse_080_eclipse_installation.png(Installing software in progress ...)!

p=. Installing software in progress ...

If the installation was completed successfully, Eclipse needs a restart in order to have the changes take effect. A dialog asks whether you want to restart Eclipse right now or later:

!images/inst_eclipse_090_eclipse_restart.png(Restarting Eclipse after software installation)!

p=. Restarting Eclipse after software installation

After the restart, Eclipse displays its _Welcome_ window, now also featuring YAKINDU Statechart Tools:

!images/inst_eclipse_100_eclipse_sct_help.png(Eclipse presenting the "Welcome" window)!

p=. Eclipse presenting the _Welcome_ window



h2(#inst_updating-yakindu-statechart-tools). Updating YAKINDU Statechart Tools

To check whether a new YAKINDU Statechart Tools release is available and to install it, please select the _Help → Check for Updates_ menu item.

!images/inst_eclipse_update_010_eclipse_menu_check_for_updates.png(Selecting "Help → Check for Updates" in the main menu)!

p=. Selecting _Help → Check for Updates_ in the main menu

If Eclipse finds any software items to be updated – not just YAKINDU Statechart Tools –, it will guide you through the process of updating them. Generally Eclipse has to be restarted afterwards to have any changes take effect.

You can configure Eclipse as follows to automatically check for updates:

Select the _Window → Preferences_ menu item. The _Preferences_ dialog opens.

Go to the _Install/Update → Automatic Updates_ section. Here you can configure whether and when Eclipse should check for updates and what to do when it finds any.
