h1(#generating-state-machine-code-headless). Headless code generation

As the state machine code is fully derived from the statechart model, it is best practice to generate it on the fly during a CI-build instead of polluting your version control system with generated artifacts. Since the release 2.9.0 of YAKINDU Statechart Tools provides a headless code generator infrastructure that allows integration in continuous build environments.  

The headless code generator can simply be called from the command line and thus can be integrated with different CI-Tools easily. No matter if you use Gradle (link:https://gradle.org/ ), Maven (link:https://maven.apache.org/)
or Make (link:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make) all you need is a java runtime on your build machine.

h2(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-installation). Installation

The headless code generator comes as an OSGi application which can generally be installed into every eclipse installation.

If you download the "Professional Edition":https://info.itemis.com/yakindu/statecharts/pro the headless code generation feature is already available and no further installation is required.
When you download the "Open Edition":https://info.itemis.com/download-yakindu-statechart-tools you have to install the headless code generation feature from the SCT Pro update site.

To do so open the 'Help > Install New Software...' wizard, open the "SCT Pro update site":https://info.itemis.com/yakindu/statecharts/pro and choose the "YAKINDU headless Code Generator" feature.
Even if it is just available on the SCT Pro update site the headless code generation application is free to use for all users of YAKINDU Statechart Tools.

After clicking "Finish" the installation process will start. If the 'Install New Software...' wizard successfully finished, you have to restart your application. Afterwards you should have a look into the root folder of your installation directory.

There you will find a new file called headless.ini which is needed for headless generator execution described in the following chapters.

h2(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-execute). Executing the headless code generation

Once you have installed the headless code generation feature you might want to test if everything is fine firstly. To do so open a shell and go to the root folder (eclipse root directory) of your SCT installation. 

h3(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-execute-test). A first call

By typing in one of the following platform specific commands into the shell the headless application will be triggered. The '-h' parameter leads into showing the integrated help information.

Windows

bc. 
eclipsec.exe --launcher.ini headless.ini -h

Linux

bc. 
./SCT --launcher.ini headless.ini -h

Mac

bc. 
./SCT --launcher.ini headless.ini -h

If you can see the help contents similar to the following, the general installation of the headless code generation application is properly done.

h3(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-execute-gen). Lets generate Code

As now we know everything is installed correctly we can go ahead to execute the code generation a first time. For this documentation we assume the following simple directory structure including SCT related files like generator models and statechart models.

!images/docu_headless_directory_structure.png(Headless Directory Structure)!

If you use the standard eclipse workspace layout where the workspace root includes projects without an additional hierarchy, which than include your model files everything would be fine without a change.

Open a shell within the root folder of your SCT installation and enter one of the following platform specific commands after replacing [pathToBasedir] with the concrete path of the base directory.

Windows

bc. 
eclipsec.exe --launcher headless.ini -basedir [pathToBasedir] -sgen project/default.sgen -m project/default.sct

Mac

bc. 
./SCT --launcher.ini headless.ini -basedir [pathToBasedir] -sgen project/default.sgen -m project/default.sct

Linux

bc. 
./SCT --launcher.ini headless.ini -basedir [pathToBasedir] -sgen project/default.sgen -m project/default.sct

h4(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-execute-gen-output). Sample Output

See the following output as a result of the command line call. 

bc.

1 gen model(s) and 1 statechart(s) loaded.
Generating 'default' to target project 'project' ...
default done.
Generated (1 of 1) gen model(s).

As you can see the headless code generation has properly executed. The generated code will be placed in a folder depending from the values configured within your generator model file. Within our sample the generator modepl contains the following content.

bc. 
GeneratorModel for yakindu::java {
	statechart default {
		feature Outlet {
			targetProject = "project"
			targetFolder = "src-gen"
		}
	}
}

So for our example this means the generated code can be found in 

	**[basedir] / project / src-gen/...**
 
h3(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-sample-parameter). Parameter

By having a closer look to the parameters you will notice that all parameters are optional. This is because if you have a directory structure based on the eclipse workspace standard (projects within root, no additional hierarchies) everything can be calculated automatically.

h4(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-sample-parameter-basedir). Base Directory

The base directory (-basedir) is used for two major tasks. Firstly it is used to calculate the absolute paths to model & genmodel locations if they are given as relative values. Secondly it is used as the base directory to calculate the target generation folder depending on the values given within a generator model.

The target folder for generated artifacts will ever be calculated by the the rule 

	**[basedir] / [sgen.targetProject] / [sgen.targetFolder]**

h4(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-sample-parameter-genmodel). Generator Model

The parameter genmodel (-sgen) can be used to select generator models (*.sgen) more specifically. The value can be absolute or relative and can be a file or folder. 
* If the value is relative the resulting folder during runtime would be calculated by the rule *[basedir]/[-sgen value]*
* If a folder is given the generator application will search for all *.sgen recursively 

h4(#generating-state-machine-code-headless-sample-parameter-model). Model Files

The parameter model (-m) can be used to select models (*.sct) more specifically. The value can be absolute or relative and can be a file or folder. 
* If the value is relative the resulting folder during runtime would be calculated by the rule *[basedir]/[-m value]*
* If a folder is given the generator application will search for all *.sct recursively
