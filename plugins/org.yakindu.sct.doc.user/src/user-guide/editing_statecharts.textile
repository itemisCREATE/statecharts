h1(#edit_editing_statecharts). Editing statecharts

h2(#edit_creating_and_deleting_statecharts). Creating and deleting statecharts

Statecharts are comprised in *statechart model files*. The filename extension of these files is @.sct@. Their internal format is "XML Metadata Interchange":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Metadata_Interchange or "XMI":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Metadata_Interchange, which is an XML language.



h3(#edit_creating_a_statechart). Creating a statechart

###. FIXME: Unify the following with the tutorial text!

In order to create a new statechart, use the _project explorer_ view:
# Right-click on a project or on a folder you want to create the new statechart in. The context menu appears.
# In the context menu, select _New → Other…_. The _New_ dialog appears.
# In the _New_ dialog, select _YAKINDU SCT → Statechart Model_ and click _Next >_. The _New YAKINDU Statechart_ wizard appears.
# In the _File Name_ field, enter a filename for the statechart file to be created. The filename extension must be _.sct_.
# Click _Next >_.
# In the wizard, select a statechart domain. Which domains are available depend on your YAKINDU Statechart Tools license. The _Default_ domain for "normal" statecharts without any language integration is always available.
# Click _Finish_.
# If the _Confirm Perspective Switch_ dialog appears, answer its question as you see fit.
# The new statechart file is created in the location you specified and opened in the "statechart editor":#edit_editor_ui.



h3(#edit_copying_an_existing_statechart). Copying an existing statechart

In order to copy an existing statechart file, proceed as follows:
# In the _project explorer_ view, right-click on the statechart's filename. The context menu appears.
# In the context menu, select _Copy_.
# Right-click on the project or folder you want to insert the copied file in. The context menu appears.
# In the context menu, select _Paste_.
# If there is already a file with the same name as the file to be copied in the target project or folder – which is always the case if you are copying a file within the same project or directory –, the _Name conflict_ dialog appears.
## Specify a name for the new file. The _Name conflict_ dialog and makes a suggestion, which you can modify.
## Click _OK_ to paste the new file to the target project or folder.
# If the target project or folder does not contain a file with the same name as the source file, the copied file will have the same name as the original.



h3(#edit_deleting_a_statechart). Deleting a statechart

In order to delete a statechart file, proceed as follows:
# Right-click on the statechart file in the _Project Explorer_ view. The context menu appears.
# In the context menu, select _Delete_.
# The _Delete Resources_ confirmation dialog appears. You have three choices:
## Click _Preview >_ to inspect what the delete operation is going to do, if confirmed.
## Click _Cancel_ to cancel the delete operation. Your statechart file will persist.
## Click _OK_ to actually delete the statechart file.




h2(#edit_editor_ui). Editor UI

YAKINDU Statechart Tools comes with a *statechart editor*. This section explains the statechart editor and how you can use it to graphically edit your statecharts.



h3(#edit_sc_modeling_perspective). _SC Modeling_ perspective

_SC Modeling_ is an Eclipse perspective supporting the modeling of statecharts. The perspective defines the following views and their positions:
* _Project Explorer_ (left): This view displays your workspace and projects, folders, and files contained therein. You can also use the _Project Explorer_ to inspect the internal structure of your statechart models.
* _Properties_ (bottom): This view displays properties, regarding the semantic model or the graphical appearance, of the selected element in the statechart editor. You can directly edit these properties in this view.
* _Problems_ (bottom): This view displays errors and warnings existing in your workspace. Double-clicking on an entry typically opens the location of the respective error or warning.
* _Tasks_ (bottom): This view displays any tasks you have defined in your statechart previously. Section "&quot;Working with statechart tasks&quot;":#edit_working_with_statechart_tasks explains how to do that.
* _Outline_ (right): This view is a bird's eye view on the opened statechart. It also indicates the current viewport for better orientation in large models.

You can change the positions and sizes of these views, you can delete them, or add more views, using standard Eclipse mechanisms.



h3(#edit_canvas). Canvas

The canvas is the statechart editor's drawing area. When you create a new statechart model, the canvas comprises the "definition section":../user-guide/statechart_language.html#sclang_definition_section and a single "region":../user-guide/statechart_language#sclang_regions.

The following list gives an overview of what kind of actions you can perform on the canvas:
* Add or remove a region
** To add a region to the canvas, select _Region_ in the "editor palette":#edit_editor_palette, then click on the canvas location you want to place the region.
** To remove a region from the canvas, select the region, then
*** press the @[Del]@ key, or
*** select _Delete from model_ in the context menu, or
*** select _Edit → Delete_ in the menu bar.
* Zooming
** Press and hold @[Ctrl]@ and turn the mouse wheel to zoom in or out.
** Right-click on the canvas to open its context menu. In the context menu, several zooming functions are available in the _Zoom_ submenu.



h3(#edit_editor_palette). Editor palette

The editor palette provides you with a set of various actions and statechart editing tools. By default, the palette is located right of the canvas, but you can also drag it to the left.

You can hide the palette by clicking on the small triangle on the right-hand side in the palette's title bar. Click on the triangle again to make the palette reappear.

!(tiny)images/docu_editor_palette_010_overview.png(Editor palette)!

p=. Editor palette


h4(#edit_editing_action_tools). Editing action tools

Below its title bar, the palette contains a toolbar with the following editing action tools (from left to right):
| *Symbol* | *Action* | *Description* |
| !(inlinemediaobject)images/docu_editor_palette_020_symbol_select.png(Editor palette symbol "Select")! | Select | Left-click at an object to select it. |
| !(inlinemediaobject)images/docu_editor_palette_030_symbol_zoom_in.png(Editor palette symbol "Zoom in")! | Zoom in | Left-click to zoom in. Press @[Shift]@ and left-click to zoom out. Drag to zoom to selection. |

| !(inlinemediaobject)images/docu_editor_palette_070_symbol_note.png(Editor palette symbol "Note")! | Note | Create a note, a text or a note attachment. |


h4(#edit_statechart_elements_tools). Statechart elements tools

The palette comprises a couple of tools serving to add statechart elements to the diagram (from top to bottom):

| *Symbol* | *Description* |
| !images/docu_editor_palette_210_tool_transition.png(Editor palette element tool "Transition")! | Adds a "transition":../user-guide/statechart_language.html#sclang_transitions. |

h3(#edit_outline_view). Outline view

The _Outline_ view allows you to keep the big picture of your statechart model and navigate it easily. It displays the model outline either as a graphical overview or as a hierarchical outline.


h4(#edit_graphical_overview). Graphical overview

Click on the _Overview_ icon in the _Outline_ view's title bar to engage the graphical overview.

While the statechart editor window – due to zooming or the size of the whole statechart – might display a cutout only, the _Outline_ view shows the whole diagram as an overview. It is scaled down as needed to completely fit into the available area.

A light-grey overlay rectangle represents the statechart editor's "viewport":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewport.
* Drag this rectangle with your mouse to move the statechart editor's viewport.
* Click into the outline view to position the rectangle's center to the point you have clicked.


h4(#edit_hierarchical_outline). Hierarchical outline

Click on the _Outline_ icon in the _Outline_ view's title bar to engage the hierarchical outline.



h3(#edit_problems_view). Problems view

The _problems_ view by default lists all errors, warnings and other types of messages in all open projects.

The messages are grouped by message type, typically "error" or "warning". Click on the show/hide symbol to open or close the respective message group's contents.

Double-clicking on an entry in the _problems_ view takes you directly to the resource or model element causing the problem.

You can configure the _problems_ view in a multitude of ways, e.g. to group entries by different criteria, to sort them in a specific way, or to restrict them to certain projects. You can even define multiple _problems_ views, each with different selection or display criteria.

To start configuring the _problems_ view, click on the small triangle pointing downwards in the _Problem_ view's title bar. A drop-down menu will open and display the options that you have.

To configure the view click the small triangle pointing downwards in the view's title bar. A drop-down menu opens and shows the options you have.

bq. *Please note:* The _problems_ view reflects the error/warning status of _persisted_ statecharts only, i.e. statecharts that have been saved to the statechart file. If you create an error during editing, for example a new state that is not (yet) connected to any other state, the respective element will have an error marker on the canvas, however, it will not appear in the _problems_ view, unless you have saved the statechart. The same holds true for resolved errors: An error will disappear from the _problems_ view only after you saved the fixed error to the statechart file.




h2(#edit_editing_states_and_other_nodes). Editing states and other nodes

Generally, there are two different ways to edit states and other nodes:
* Using the graphical editor to modify a node in the diagram.
* Selecting a node and editing its properties in the _properties_ view.

There are certain properties that you can only edit with one of these methods. For example, to modify a state's position or size, you have to use the statechart editor. To change a state's transitions' priorities, you have to use the _properties_ view.




h2(#edit_editing_transitions). Editing transitions

Generally, there are two different ways to edit transitions:
* Using the graphical editor to modify a transition in the diagram.
* Selecting a transition and editing its properties in the _properties_ view.

There are certain properties that you can only edit with one of these methods. For example, to add guidance points to a transition's arrow, you have to use the statechart editor. To change a transition's arrow's color, you have to use the _properties_ view.




h2(#edit_editing_the_documentation_of_states_and_transitions). Editing the documentation of states and transitions

You can attach documentation to states and transitions. In this context, documentation is some text offering additional information to a human reader. In the model, it does not serve any functional purpose.

By default, a state's rectangle shows the state's behaviour, and a transition shows its expression alongside its arrow. You can instead display an objects's documentation, i.e. the documentation of a state or transition:
# Right-click on the object.
# In the context menu, select _Toggle documentation_.
# The object now shows its documentation in place of the formerly displayed text.

In order to return back to the object's normal view, select _Toggle documentation_ again.

While the documentation is shown, you can modify it in the statechart editor. Double-click on the documentation text field to start editing it. Click outside the state or transition to quit editing.

The _properties_ view of states and transition always shows both documentation and statechart language elements side by side in different compartments. This might be a more comfortable way of editing any of them.




h2(#edit_editing-regions). Editing regions

In a statechart model, you can have
* top-level regions, which are directly placed on the "canvas":#edit_canvas, and
* regions inside of composite or orthogonal states.

Their graphical representation differ somewhat, thus editing them is also somewhat different.



h3(#edit_editing-top-level-regions). Editing top-level regions

You can place a top-level region anywhere on the "canvas":#edit_canvas, and you can change its size at will. To change the location or the size of a region, use the graphical editor. Drag the region to move it elsewhere. Use a selected region's handles to resize it.



h3(#edit_editing_regions_in_orthogonal_states). Editing regions in orthogonal states

Regions inside an orthogonal or composite state are confined by their enclosing state. They are sized automatically, depending on their contents, and they are arranged either vertically or horizontally.

You can toggle between vertical and horizontally representation of regions in an orthogonal state as follows:
# Right-click on the orthogonal state's title. The context menu opens.
# In the context menu, select _Toggle Subregion Alignment_.
# The layout of the regions switches from horizontal to vertical or vice versa.



h3(#edit_changing_the_name_of_a_region). Changing the name of a region

You can change the name of a region in the statechart editor as well as in the _properties_ view.
* In the statechart editor,
** double-click on the region's current name,
** edit the name in the text field that appeares after double-clicking,
** press the @[Return]@ key to finish editing.
* In the properties view,
** modify the _Region Name_ property. It is a region's only property you can access through the properties view.




h2(#edit_editing_hierarchies). Editing hierarchies

Statecharts can get rather big and complex. *"Composite states":../user-guide/statechart_language#sclang_composite_states* are a way to reduce complexity and thus make statecharts easier to create, comprehend and maintain. A composite state comprises a state machine of its own within a "region":../user-guide/statechart_language#sclang_regions. The states belonging to such a nested state machine are called substates. *"Orthogonal states":../user-guide/statechart_language#sclang_orthogonal_states* are a generalization of composite states, comprising two or more independent state machines in separate regions that are executed virtually concurrently.

A complementary way to mitigate the size of large statecharts are *subdiagrams*. A subdiagram externalizes the possibly large region(s) contained by a composite state into a subdiagram. In this case the composite state no longer displays its substates. Instead it is visualized very similarly to a regular state. The only difference is a small icon in its lower right corner, marking it as a composite state and giving access to its internal structure: the subdiagram. This way a composite state consumes much less space and gives the user the opportunity to better envision the overall picture. Section "&quot;Using subdiagrams&quot;":#edit_using_subdiagrams explains how to work with subdiagrams, how to create them and how to inline them again, if needed.

Composite states resp. subdiagrams can be nested to any depth.

The statechart editor provides various "refactorings":#edit_refactorings to support editing these hierarchies.




h2(#edit_using_subdiagrams). Using subdiagrams

As a statechart grows, it may easily become too big to still give a comprehensive overview of the whole model. Subdiagrams come as a solution. Basically, you can "fold away" a composite state into a subdiagram.

!images/docu_subdiagram_010_inline.png(Composite state)!

p=. Composite state

When the _Extract Subdiagram_ "refactoring":#edit_refactorings is executed on a composite state, all containing regions are extracted into a separate diagram. The composite state no longer clutters the diagram with all its internal details, but instead appears almost like a normal state. The only difference is a small decorator icon in the lower-right corner of the state, indicating the existence of a subdiagram. When you hover over this decorator with the mouse cursor, you'll see a small preview of the subdiagram's content.

Extracting a subdiagram creates "entry and exit points":../user-guide/statechart_language#sclang_entry_and_exit_points in the subdiagram as needed.

!images/docu_subdiagram_020_preview.png(Subdiagram popup window)!

p=. Subdiagram popup window

A click on the decorator opens the subdiagram in a separate editor tab. The breadcrumb at the top allows easy navigation throughout the hierachy levels.

!images/docu_subdiagram_030_subdiagram_editor.png(Subdiagram editor)!

p=. Subdiagram editor

Using the "inlining subdiagram refactoring":#edit_inlining_subdiagram, you can turn a subdiagram back into the composite state.




h2(#edit_refactorings). Refactorings

Refactoring means modifying certain model aspects while maintaining the model's semantics. The statechart editor allows for the refactoring of variables, events, interfaces, and states, including composite and orthogonal states. A state's context menu contains the _Refactor_ submenu with the individual refactoring actions explained below. Depending on certain conditions, a refactoring might be executable or not, which will be explained below.



h3(#edit_renaming_variables_events_and_interfaces). Renaming variables, events and interfaces

Using the _Rename_ refactoring, you can change the name of a variable, event or interface throughout your statechart model. Each occurrence of that name will be changed to the new name.

To initiate renaming, right-click on the name of a variable, event or interface in the diagram editor, in the definition section, or in a text field in the _properties_ view, then select _Rename …_.

!images/docu_refactoring_rename_010_renaming_variable.png(Renaming a variable)!

p=. Renaming a variable

* The _Rename …_ dialog opens.
* In that dialog, type the entity's new name into the text field.
* Click on _OK_ to change each occurence of the old name to the new name.
* Click on _Cancel_ to not rename anything.



h3(#edit_folding_incoming_actions). Folding incoming actions

When building a statechart model step by step, you may come into a situation where you have defined several transitions having the same target state and sharing a common set of actions.

The _Fold Incoming Actions_ refactoring moves these actions from the transitions to the target state's entry block. To preserve model semantics, only actions that are defined on _all_ incoming transitions will be moved. Since the execution order must be preserved, the refactoring algorithm starts with the right-most action and proceeds action by action to the left. As soon as it detects an action that is not defined on _all_ incoming transitions, it stops moving actions to the entry block.

Consider the following model:

!images/docu_refactoring_fold_incoming_actions_010_example_01.png(Moving incoming actions to entry block)!

p=. Moving incoming actions to entry block

Only the most-right action _y += 42_ can be moved to the entry block of the target state. Although _x += 1_ is also a common action of both transitions, it cannot be moved to the target state, because the semantics of the _B → Target_ transition would change, in that _y = x_ would be executed before _x_ had been incremented.

Another aspect to take into account are transitions leading to target states that are nested in composite states. Consider the following example:

!images/docu_refactoring_fold_incoming_actions_020_example_02.png(Moving incoming actions into a nested state's entry block)!

p=. Moving incoming actions into a nested state's entry block

The actions _y = x_ of the two incoming transitions leading to the _Target_ state cannot be moved to _Target_'s entry block, because doing so would change the model's semantics. The reason is the composite state's entry action _x += 1_. It will be executed _after_ the action of transition _A → Target_ and _before_ the actions in the entry block of _Target_. Moving _y = x_ from the transition to _Target_'s entry block would change that order. The statechart editor pays regard to this constraint and prohibits the refactoring.

To fold incoming actions, right-click on the state to refactor, then select _Refactor → Fold Incoming Actions_ in the context menu. The menu entry is active only if there are actual actions to move into the target state's entry block, with the above rules applied.



h3(#edit_folding_outgoing_actions). Folding outgoing actions

The _fold outgoing actions_ refactoring is similar to "folding incoming actions":#edit_folding_incoming_actions, except that it moves actions from outgoing transitions to the source state's exit block. To preserve model semantics, only actions that are defined on _all_ outgoing transitions will be moved. Since the execution order must be preserved, the refactoring algorithm starts with the left-most action and proceeds action by action to the right. As soon as it detects an action that is not defined on _all_ outgoing transitions, it stops moving actions to the exit block.

Preconditions for this refactoring are analog to "&quot;Folding incoming actions&quot;":#edit_folding_incoming_actions. Consider the following example:

!images/docu_refactoring_fold_outgoing_actions_010_example_01.png(Moving outgoing actions to exit block)!

p=. Moving outgoing actions to exit block

Here, the actions _y = x_ cannot be moved from the outgoing transitions to the exit block of the source state, because the composite state has an exit action. For the _Source → A_ transition, the proper execution order is to first execute _x += 1_ of the nesting composite state's exit block, followed by _y = x_ of the transition. Moving _y = x_ to the exit block of state _Source_ would reverse this order and thus will be prohibited by the statechart editor.

To fold outgoing actions, right-click on the state to refactor, then select _Refactor → Fold Outgoing Actions_ in the context menu. The menu entry is active only if there are actual actions to move into the source state's exit block, with the above rules applied.



h3(#edit_unfolding_entry_actions). Unfolding entry actions

This refactoring is the reverse of "folding incoming actions":#edit_folding_incoming_actions. It removes all entry actions from a target state and appends them to each of its incoming transition's actions.

Transitions crossing the borders of composite states enclosing the target state might inhibit refactoring, see section "&quot;Unfolding exit actions&quot;":#edit_unfolding_exit_actions for an analogous example.

To unfold entry actions, right-click on the state to refactor, then select _Refactor → Unfold Entry Actions_ in the context menu. The menu entry is active only if there are actual actions in the state's entry block that can be moved to the state's incoming transitions while maintaining semantic equivalence and preserving execution order.



h3(#edit_unfolding_exit_actions). Unfolding exit actions

This refactoring is the reverse of "folding outgoing actions":#edit_folding_outgoing_actions. It moves all exit actions from a source state and prepends them to each of its outgoing transition's actions.

Transitions crossing the borders of composite states enclosing the source state might inhibit refactoring. Consider the following example:

!images/docu_refactoring_unfold_outgoing_actions_010_example_01.png(Unfolding exit actions to outgoing transitions)!

p=. Unfolding exit actions to outgoing transitions

Unfolding the exit action _y = x_ of the _Source_ state to the two outgoing transitions would be invalid, because the execution order of said action and the composite state's exit action would be reversed.

To unfold exit actions, right-click on the state to refactor, then select _Refactor → Unfold Exit Actions_ in the context menu. The menu entry is active only if there are actual actions in the state's exit block that can be moved to the state's outgoing transitions, while maintaining semantic equivalence and preserving execution order.



h3(#edit_grouping_states_into_composite). Grouping states into composite

This refactoring creates a new composite state containing the selected states. The latter must belong to the same region.

To execute this refactoring, select one or more states from the same region, right-click on one of them, and select _Refactor → Group States Into Composite_ in the context menu. The menu entry is active only if the selected states belong to the same region.



h3(#edit_extracting_subdiagram). Extracting subdiagram

This refactoring extracts the regions of the selected composite or orthogonal state into a subdiagram. Entry and exit points are created as needed in the subdiagram. See section "&quot;Using subdiagrams&quot;":#edit_using_subdiagrams for more details.

To extract a subdiagram, right-click on the composite or orthogonal state to refactor, then select _Refactor → Extract Subdiagram_ in the context menu.



h3(#edit_inlining_subdiagram). Inlining subdiagram

This refactoring inlines the selected node's subdiagram in order to show it directly in the composite state's diagram region. See section "&quot;Using subdiagrams&quot;":#edit_using_subdiagrams for more details.

To inline a subdiagram, right-click on a composite state with a subdiagram, then select _Refactor → Inline Subdiagram_ in the context menu.




h2(#edit_using_editing_proposals). Using editing proposals

h3(#edit_using_text_proposals). Using text proposals

Proposals assist you when writing statechart language expressions. Whenever editing some text anywhere in the graphical statechart editor or in the properties view, at any point you can press the @[Ctrl+Space]@ key combination to get some context-sensitive help.

Certain proposals, like statechart language keywords, have documentation associated with them. When such a proposal is selected, either using the mouse or the keyboard, this information is shown in a secondary popup window next to the proposal.

You can either use the mouse or the keyboard to select and insert a proposal in the text:
* Double-click on a proposal to insert it in the text at the current position.
* Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate to the proposal you want to insert in the text, then press @[Return]@ to actually insert the proposal at the current position.



h3(#edit_using_action_proposals_on_states). Using actions proposals on states

When a state is selected, @[Ctrl+Space]@ opens a popup window showing a context-sensitive menu with possible action choices to perform on the state.

These action proposals have additional information associated to them. When a proposal is selected either using the mouse or the keyboard, this information is shown in a secondary popup window next to the proposal.

You can either use the mouse or the keyboard to execute a proposal:
* Double-click on a proposal to execute it.
* Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate to the proposal you want to execute, then press @[Return]@ to actually execute it.




h2(#edit_comparing_statecharts). Comparing statecharts

The statechart editor allows for comparing two or even three statecharts to each other, displaying the results, and possibly merging selected differences. Figure "&quot;Comparing two statecharts&quot;":#edit_fig_comparing_two_statecharts shows a sample comparison result.

p(#edit_fig_comparing_two_statecharts). 

!images/docu_comparing_statecharts_010_result.png(Comparing two statecharts)!

p=. Comparing two statecharts



h3(#edit_comparing_a_statechart_to_its_local_history). Comparing a statechart to its local history

Whenever a statechart is saved to its statechart file, the previous version of the file is saved to the local history.

bq. *Warning:* The local history typically contains a few recent versions of a file. However, you should never rely on anything being available in the local history at all. It is definitely no replacement for a data backup or a version control system

To compare a statechart to an older version in the local history, proceed as follows:

# In the _project_ view, right-click on a statechart model file. The context menu opens.
# In the context menu, select _Compare With → Local History…_.
# In the local history, double-click on the file's version to compare to.
# The comparison results are shown.



h3(#edit_comparing_two_statecharts). Comparing two statecharts

To compare two statecharts, proceed as follows:

# In the _project_ view, select two statechart model files.
# Right-click on one of the selected statechart model files. The context menu opens.
# In the context menu, select _Compare With → Each Other_.
# The comparison results are shown.



h3(#edit_comparing_three_statecharts). Comparing three statecharts

To compare three statecharts, proceed as follows:

# In the _project_ view, select three statechart model files.
# Right-click on one of the selected statechart model files. The context menu opens.
# In the context menu, select _Compare With → Each Other_.
# The _Select common ancestor_ dialog appears. It shows the three selected statechart model files.
# Select one of them. It will be regarded as the common ancestor of the two others.
# The comparison results are shown.




h2(#edit_exporting_a_statechart_as_an_image_file). Exporting a statechart as an image file

A complete statechart or parts of it can be saved as an image file as shown in the following steps:

* In the statechart editor:
** To create an image file _of the whole statechart_ with all regions and definition section, right-click on the q.
** To create an image file _of some statechart elements_, select these elements and right-click on one of them. In the example below, the main region has been selected.
* The context menu appears.<br/>!images/docu_exporting_statechart_as_image_010_save_as_menu_item.png(Selecting the "Save As Image File..." menu item)!
* In the context menu, select _File → Save As Image File..._.
* The _Save As Image File_ dialog appears.<br/>!images/docu_exporting_statechart_as_image_020_save_as_dialog.png(The "Save As Image File" dialog)!
* Specify the filesystem folder for the exported image file in the _Folder_ text field.
* Enter the name of the export image file into the _File Name_ text field. The filename extension depends on the selected image format (see below).
* Select the image format from the _Image Format_ drop-down menu. YAKINDU Statechart Tools supports the following formats:<br/><table><tbody><tr><th>Image format</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>BMP, GIF, PNG</td><td>Lossless pixel image formats</td></tr><tr><td>JPG, JPEG</td><td>Lossy pixel image format. You can specify the image quality via the _Quality (%)_ setting.</td></tr><tr><td>SVG</td><td>Scalable Vector Graphics</td></tr><tr><td>PDF</td><td>Portable Document Format</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>*Note*</p><p>The image export functionality is subject to the capabilities of your Java Runtime Environment (JRE). You can export images only in those image formats your JRE actually supports.</p></blockquote>
* The _Quality (%)_ text field is active for JPEG images only. JPEG is a lossy format, and reducing the quality results in a smaller file size. However, due to the nature of statechart images, a lossless format like PNG is most often a better choice, for sure in quality and perhaps even in file size.
* Check _Overwrite existing file without warning_ if you don't want to be bothered by a confirmation dialog which will appear if the export file already exists.
* Check _Export to HTML_ to create both the image file plus an HTML file including it.




h2(#edit_working_with_statechart_tasks). Working with statechart tasks

While you are busily developing a statechart, it is quite common that you have ideas about what else you could or should do to improve the statechart. However, in order to not get side-tracked, you decide to do it later. Examples are to write a proper documentation for a state, to refine a transition whose final specification you don't have yet, etc.

For all these and other purposes you can define _tasks_ in all places in your statechart where a comment is allowed. A task is a special comment comprising the words @FIXME@ or @TODO@. Adding one of these words to a comment is called "tagging" the comment as a task.

The nice thing is that you don't have to remember all the places you took a note and defined a task. YAKINDU Statechart Tools lists all of your tasks in the _tasks_ view. Figure "&quot;Tasks defined by tags in the statechart showing up in the _tasks_ view&quot;":#edit_fig_tasks_defined_by_tags_in_the_statechart_showing_up_in_the_tasks_view is showing an example with various tasks being defined in a transition, in a state's behavior, in a state's documentation, and in the statecharts definition section.

p(#edit_fig_tasks_defined_by_tags_in_the_statechart_showing_up_in_the_tasks_view). 

!images/docu_task_tags_010_task_view.png(Tasks defined by tags in the statechart showing up in the "tasks" view)!

p=. Tasks defined by tags in the statechart showing up in the _tasks_ view

In the example, state *B* has been selected in the statechart editor (top), so that the tasks defined in the state's behavior and in its documentation are shown in the _properties_ view (middle).

Task have a priority. While @TODO@ stamps a task as being of normal priority, @FIXME@ indicates a high-priority task.

By default, tasks are ordered by priority in the _tasks_ view (bottom), and high-priority tasks are accentuated by a red exclamation mark. However, you can change the sorting order and other settings using the view's menu. Click on the little triangle on the right-hand side of the _task_ view's title to open the view menu.

Double-clicking on a task in the _tasks_ view navigates to the location where the task is defined. If needed, the corresponding statechart diagram is opened. The graphical element holding the task definition is highlighted.

bq.. *Note*

The _tasks_ view is updated only when the statechart is saved.



###.. h3(#edit_defining_task_tags). Defining task tags

# In the main menu, select _Window → Preferences_. The _Preferences_ Dialog opens.
# In the _Preferences_ Dialog goto _Java → Compiler → Task Tags_ to edit your task tag preferences. A task tag has one of the priorities _High_, _Normal_, or _Low_.




h2(#edit_using_the_example_wizard). Using the example wizard

The _example wizard_ gives you convenient access to the examples in the public YAKINDU Statechart Tools "examples repository":https://github.com/Yakindu/examples. You can browse the available examples and read their documentation in the wizard. By a simple click you can instantiate an example as a new Eclipse project. Within such a sample project, you can explore and modify the state machine models using the statechart editor, run the state machines in the simulator, generate source code, etc.

Upon its first invocation, the example wizard downloads the complete examples repository and creates a copy on your local disk. After that, all examples are immediately available to you, even if you are offline. The example wizard will take notice when new examples are available in the online repository and offers to download them. It is also possible to download the examples repository out-of-band and later tell the example wizard where it can find the local copy.



h3(#edit_downloading_the_examples_repository). Downloading the examples repository

When you start the example wizard for the first time, it does not yet have any examples available that it could show to you. Thus downloading the online examples repository is required as a special first step.

# In order to start the example wizard, select _File → New → Example…_ in the YAKINDU Statechart Tools main menu. The _New Example_ dialog opens.
# In the _New Example_ dialog, select _YAKINDU Statechart Examples_, then click on _Next >_. The example wizard opens.
# The example wizard outputs a message saying that it could not find any examples and offers to download them.
# Click on the _Download_ button. The example wizard downloads the online examples repository and creates a clone of it on your local computer. This can take some time. – Downloading can fail for a variety of reasons, not being able to access the Github server being one of them. If this happens, don't panic – and read how to "manually create a local copy of the examples repository":#edit_manually_creating_a_local_copy_of_the_examples_repository.

!images/docu_example_wizard_download.png(Example wizard when invoked for the first time)!

p=. Example wizard when invoked for the first time

When the download is completed, you can "browse the examples repository":#edit_browsing_the_example_repository.



h3(#edit_changing_the_repository_location). Changing the repository location

You can change the location used by the example wizard to store the online repository's local clone.

# When the example wizard shows the _Download_ button on its first start, click on the link _"change the storage location here"_. The example wizard's preferences dialog opens. Alternatively, open _Window → Preferences_ and select _YAKINDU SCT → Example Wizard_.
# On the examples preferences page, enter the desired directory into the _Storage Location_ text field.
# Click on _OK_. The dialog closes.

You can change the storage location of your local examples repository clone at any time. In fact, it doesn't even need to be a clone of the official examples repository. Any directory containing subdirectories with YAKINDU Statechart Tools examples suffices.

* If the directory exists, the example wizard searches it for examples and displays them.
* If the directory does not exist, the example wizard behaves as if being called for the first time. That is, it informs the user that it does not have any examples yet and offers to download them.



h3(#edit_browsing_the_example_repository). Browsing the examples repository

The example wizard shows the available examples on the left-hand side.

Click on an example to select it and show its documentation on the right-hand side.

Click on _Finish_ to create the selected example as a new project in your workspace.

!images/docu_example_wizard_browse.png(Example wizard showing all available examples)!

p=. Example wizard showing all available examples



h3(#edit_manually_creating_a_local_copy_of_the_examples_repository). Manually creating a local copy of the examples repository

The _example wizard_ tries to download a copy of the YAKINDU Statechart Tools examples repository and install it on your local machine. However, if your Internet access is restricted or you don't have Internet access at all, this will fail.

To circumvent this problem, you can

# download the examples repository elsewhere, i.&nbsp;e. on a computer with Internet access,
# copy it to the computer you want to run YAKINDU Statechart Tools, and
# have the example wizard work with that local copy.

Subsequently we will explain the necessary steps in detail.

Downloading the repository as a ZIP archive:

# On a computer with Internet access, go to the "examples repository's release branch":https://github.com/Yakindu/examples/tree/release.
# Click on the green _Clone or download_ button. A submenu opens.
# In the submenu, click on _Download ZIP_.
# The download starts and transfers the ZIP archive file _examples-release.zip_ to your computer.
# Copy the _examples-release.zip_ file to the computer without Internet access and continue with the following steps on that machine.
# Unpack the archive file. A directory named _examples-release_ is created, containing the YAKINDU Statechart Tools examples repository.
# In YAKINDU Statechart Tools, select _Window → Preferences_. The _preferences_ dialog opens.
# In the _preferences_ dialog, navigate to _YAKINDU SCT → Example Wizard_.
# Click on _Browse..._, and select the folder that you just extracted from the ZIP file, then click _OK_.
# On the next try, the example wizard will now show a catalogue of YAKINDU Statechart Tools examples.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository. Cloning the examples repository containing the YAKINDU Statechart Tools examples is more complex than just downloading a ZIP archive. However, you will get certain advantages in return, like the ability to detect and receive updates, the option to create your own examples and submit them as a pull request, or to get hold of the complete history of the examples repository – which could also be considered a drawback, taking its size into account.

# Clone "https://github.com/Yakindu/examples":https://github.com/Yakindu/examples to your local computer. If you are using a command-line tool, the proper command to create the directory _examples_ on your disk is:<br/>@git clone 'https://github.com/Yakindu/examples.git'@
# Step into that directory:<br/>@cd examples@
# Checkout the _release_ branch:<br/>@git checkout release@<br/>Now the _examples_ directory reflects the current release state.
# In the YAKINDU Statechart Tools main menu, select _File → New → Example…_. The _New Example_ dialog opens.
# In the _New Example_ dialog, select _YAKINDU statechart examples_ and click on _Next >_. The example wizard opens.
# When the example wizard is opened for the first time, there are no examples on the local disk yet.
# In YAKINDU Statechart Tools, select _Window → Preferences_. The _preferences_ dialog opens.
# In the _preferences_ dialog, navigate to _YAKINDU SCT → Example Wizard_.
# Click on _Browse..._, and select the folder you just cloned, then click _OK_.
# On the next try, the example wizard will show a catalogue of YAKINDU Statechart Tools examples.



h3(#edit_updating_the_examples_respository). Updating the examples repository

When the example wizard is started and the storage location is a clone of the online examples directory, it checks whether there are any updates in the online examples repository. If new examples are available or existing examples have changed in the online repository, the example wizard offers to update your local examples repository clone accordingly.

!images/docu_example_wizard_update.png(Example wizard offering to update the examples repository)!

p=. Example wizard offering to update the examples repository

* Click on the _Update_ button to update your local repository.

If your storage location is a plain directory and not a clone of the online examples repository, no update will ever be done.



h3(#edit_contributing_your_own_examples). Contributing your own examples

If you have a project that you want to share with the community, you can contribute it as an example. Once the YAKINDU team has reviewed and applied your contribution, it will be available for all users of YAKINDU Statechart Tools via the example wizard's update functionality.

For more information on how to contribute examples, please visit our "Wiki page":https://github.com/Yakindu/examples/wiki/Creating-a-YAKINDU-Statechart-Tools-Example.




h2(#edit_preferences). Preferences

Many aspects of YAKINDU Statechart Tools can be configured by _preferences_. You can find them here:

# In the main menu, select _Window → Preferences_. The _Preferences_ dialog appears.
# In the navigation on the left-hand side, scroll to _YAKINDU SCT_. Open it and its subentries as needed.
# Click on an entry to display the associated preference pane on the right-hand side of the _Preferences_ dialog, see e.g. figure "Preferences: Diagram Appearance":#edit_fig_preferences_diagram_appearance.

In the subsequent sections we will quickly walk through the preferences.

h4(#edit_colors_and_line_styles). Colors and line styles

The "diagram appearance":#edit_fig_preferences_diagram_appearance preferences define default colors for the backgrounds and borders of states and regions, as well as the default routing style for transitions and other lines, with _oblique_ and _rectilinear_ being the options at your choice.

Please keep in mind that colors and line styles will apply to _new_ elements only. Existing regions, states, etc. will remain as they are. However, you can modify the properties of an existing element anytime using its _properties_ view.


h4(#edit_showing_transition_priorities). Showing transition priorities

In order to display "transition priorities":../user-guide/statechart_language.html#sclang_transition_priorities in a statechart, set a check mark at the respective preference option. Section "&quot;Transition priorities&quot;":../user-guide/statechart_language.html#sclang_transition_priorities explains what transition priorities are and shows an example.


h4(#edit_disabling_live_validation). Disabling live validation

While you are editing a statechart, the statechart editor validates your model on each and every modification you make. That's very helpful, because the editor provides you with instant feedback, so you can see immediately what is right, wrong, or dubious, and you can take corrective action, if needed.

However, on very large and complex statechart models, validation may take a considerable amount of time, causing delays and impeding your editing. Remove the check mark from _Enable live validation_, and your model will be validated only before it is saved to the statechart file.

The IDE usually executes all generator models in current workspace. However, what might be inconvenient in some cases, especially if you have a lot of different generator models. To exercise a more fine-grained control of which generator models should be executed, it is possible to exclude or "filter away" particular generator models or entire folders from the automatic build execution. 

Please note that this is a project-specific setting, which you won't find via _Window → Preferences_. In order to create or modify a filter configuration, proceed as follows:

# In the project explorer, right-click on a project name. The context menu opens.
# In the context menu, select _Properties_. The _Properties_ dialog opens.
# In the menu on the left, select _YAKINDU SCT → SGen Filter_.
# In the settings pane on the right, use the _Add…_ and _Remove_ buttons to maintain a list of generator models or folders that have to be ignored in automatic builds.
