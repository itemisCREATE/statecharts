h1. Getting started

h2. Installation

h3. Prerequisites

The *Yakindu Statechart Tools 2* are built upon Java and Xtext. So you need to have installed a "Java Runtime Environment":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html and Xtext installed. The easier way to get this is to install the "pre configured Xtext contribution":http://xtext.itemis.com.

The *Yakindu Statechart Tools 2* need *Eclipse Indigo 3.7* or higher and *Xtext 2.0.1* exactly (no higher) to work correctly.

h3. Installing the YAKINDU-Plug-Ins

You install the Yakindu Plug-Ins from the update site: http://updates.yakindu.com/indigo/milestones. 

* Choose *Help* -> *Install new software...* from the menu bar and _Add.._ the update site *Yakindu SCT2 milestones* - http://updates.yakindu.com/indigo/milestones/
* On this update site you find two main items:
** Xtext integration utilities
*** Xtext GMF integration (XGI)
*** Xtext JFace integration (XJI)
*** Yakindu Base
** Yakindu SCT 2
*** Generator C
*** Generator Java
*** Yakindu SCT 2
*** Yakindu SCT 2 SDK

!images/updatesite_4.jpg!

The Xtext integration utilities provide Xtext functionality for Yakindu. Additionally to the base integration also GMF and JFace integration is provided here. For more details check the parts "XGI":#XGI and "XJI":#XJI.

Under Yakindu SCT 2 you can select what code generators you need and if you need the Yakindu SCT2 SDK (for developers). For users only the Yakindu SCT 2 is sufficient.

h2. Yakindu SC Modeling perspective

For state machine modeling purposes open the Yakindu *SC Modeling* perspective by choosing *Window* - *Open Perspective* - *SC Modeling*. This perspective is optimized for statechart modeling. It consists of 
* "Project Explorer":PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cnav.htm on the left
* "Outline":PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/coutline.htm View on the right
* YAKINDU Statechart Editor at the top
* "Problems":PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cprbview.htm and "Properties View":PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cpropview.htm at the bottom

h2. Yakindu SC Simulation perspective

To simulate a state machine use the Yakindu *SC Simulation* perspective by choosing *Window* - *Open Perspective* - *SC Simulation*. This perspective is optimized for simulation purposes and consists of:

* "Project Explorer":PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cnav.htm on the left
* "Outline":PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/coutline.htm view on the right top
* Simulation View on the right bottom
* Debug view at the top
* "YAKINDU Statechart Editor":PLUGIN_ROOT/org.yakindu.sct.doc.user/help/02_Getting_Started/getting_started.html?path=0_1_5#YAKINDUStatechartEditor at the bottom

h2. Yakindu Xpand Generator Project

In the context of model driven software development generators play an important role. The generator transforms the model to either another model or text like code. Yakindu generators can be written in different languages. One is Xpand. By choosing *File* - *New* - *Other...* - *YAKINDU Xpand Generator Project* you create a project optimized for writing a generator in Xpand. For more details regarding Xpand see <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.xpand.doc/help/index.html">Xpand Documentation</a>.

!images/new_xpand_project_simple.jpg!

All you need to do is to give it a speaking name and click *Finish*. The setting *Configure for Plugin Export* is an option for plugin developers and can be neglected here.

The newly created project already has a package with an Xpand starting point: the _Main.xpt_. In this file the needed metamodels are already included. It contains the entrance Xpand statement that iterates all states in the model and prints the names in a first text file.

h2. Yakindu Xtend2/Java Generator Project

The generator that transforms the state machine model into code or documentation can be written in Xtend2 and Java. Find a detailed description on Xtend2 in the "Xtend2 documentation":PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.xtext.doc/contents/01-Xtend_Introduction.html. Yakindu comes with a predefined project setting for such projects. To create such a project choose *File* - *New* - *Other...* - *YAKINDU Xtend2/Java Generator Project*. 

!images/new_java_xtend_project.jpg!

Give the project a speaking full qualified name and name also the generator java class with a full qualified name. If you also want to use Xtend activate the checkbox *Use Xtend*. A new project is created with an initial xtend file and an initial java class.

h2. YAKINDU Statechart Editor

The YAKINDU Statechart editor is used to create or modify state models. The editor automatically opens on .sct files. To create a new YAKINDU statechart model choose *File* - *New* - *Other...* - *YAKINDU Statechart model*. Give it a speaking name and click *Finish*. The newly created model is opened in the statechart editor. If you haven't already opened the SC Modeling perspective you are asked to do so.

!images/sc_editor_01.jpg!


The editor consists of three parts: the graphic canvas where the state machine is designed, the palette on the right that owns the elements to design the state machine and an integrated text editor on the left. This can be used to define internal behavior of states e.g. The language used here is called SText. The SText reference explains this language.

Warnings or errors are displayed directly on the elements that cause the problems. For more details about the problems open the Problems View if it is not already open.

h2. Simulation View

The simulation view is an interactive view to watch and control the state machine simulation. To open it either choose *Window* - *Open View* - *Other...* - *Simulation View* or open the simulation perspective. 

Start a simulation by choosing *Run* - *Run* from the menu bar when the statechart editor is _active_. 

!images/simulation_view_active.jpg!

During the simulation in the statechart editor the active state is colored red. The previous transition is colored green. The simulation view shows the events that trigger the states. In more complex statecharts you can also change values here. Beneath the table there are two clocks. One for the virtual time and one for the real time and a slider to slow down virtual time or make it faster.
