		<p>The statechart tools are one central part of YAKINDU: the modular toolkit for model driven development of embedded systems. It is based on the open source development platform Eclipse. The YAKINDU Statechart tools provide the following tools to deal with state machine diagramms:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>YAKINDU SCT editor</strong> to create and edit state charts
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>YAKINDU simulator</strong> to simulate the behavior of state charts
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>YAKINDU Xpand generator projects</strong> to create a transformation of the state chart in Xpand
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>YAKINDU Xtend/Java generator projects</strong> to create a transformation in Xtend/Java
			</li>
			<li>integrated validation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The following graph shows these features and their relation to each other:</p>
